BobbyJindal,1,"Immigration without assimilation is an invasion. Every country has the right and responsibility to police its borders, and to decide who is allowed to enter."
BobbyJindal,1,"Trump fought to secure our border, and it was becoming more secure during his tenure. The Biden administration has adopted reckless border policies that have resulted in chaos in some of our largest cities and allowed the spread of deadly illegal drugs across the country."

BobbyJindal,1,"Trump understands the importance of focusing on the threat from China to promote America's key national interests, and to avoid being distracted."
BobbyJindal,1,"Trump was the first president to correctly identify China as America's top security threat, and the first to insist we stop subsidizing our competitors through one-sided trade deals."
BobbyJindal,1,"This started with the Obama IRS going after conservative groups, and continues today with the FBI intimidating parents who show up at school board meetings. There is an obvious double standard when it comes to ignoring Biden family corruption, while going after the Trump family."
