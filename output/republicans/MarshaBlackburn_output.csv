MarshaBlackburn,1,"An illegal caught sneaking over the southern border has admitted to being a member of Hezbollah.  The Lebanese migrant headed for NY said he was hoping to “make a bomb.”  Biden’s open border is enabling terrorist threats to our nation."
MarshaBlackburn,1,"This week, I joined a roundtable discussion on the need for Congress to pass NIL legislation.  I asked former Alabama coach Nick Saban about how the NCAA’s investigation process has damaged its reputation with athletes.
