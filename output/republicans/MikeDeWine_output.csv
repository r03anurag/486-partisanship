MikeDeWine,1,"He spent most of his life building houses, starting at a very young age by helping his dad, who was a builder.¬†He spent 20 years in California, first working for a landscape architect &amp; then as a carpenter, before returning to Ohio to work with his brother Ken in building homes."
MikeDeWine,1,"Fran remembers one time her dad told John when he was about 12 to tear apart an engine and get it running but to make sure there were no parts left when he was done!¬† And after John did put it together, there were no parts left, and the engine actually ran!"
MikeDeWine,1,"Like the rest of his family, John was a tireless worker.¬† He could fix anything -- from a clock to a car to a sweeper."
MikeDeWine,1,"We lost Fran‚Äôs brother John this week.¬† He was 72. When Fran and I were married, I was blessed with five new brothers and sisters.¬† John was the fourth of Fran‚Äôs parents' six children. https://t.co/9cpwpkQDJm"
