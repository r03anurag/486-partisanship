MikeDeWine,1,"For years, John, Ken, my classmate Mark, and I have gone to the Reds opening day game . We will go again this year, but it will seem strange without him."
MikeDeWine,1,"And, when you went to his house, you would so many times find him working on something for his wife Kathy or his children or grandchildren. John was a Reds, Bengals, and OSU Buckeyes fan, although I believe he still had some affection for the San Francisco Bay Area teams."
MikeDeWine,1,"John would do anything for anybody. I can’t count the times he has come to our rescue and fixed or repaired something for us."
MikeDeWine,1,"In high school, John was a good runner.  We still have a movie Fran took of John running the Mile in the State Championship at the old track at OSU stadium."
MikeDeWine,1,"At his home near Clifton Gorge, he created his own sanctuary, planting many different trees and designing and building beautiful little ponds for his Koi and goldfish."
MikeDeWine,1,"We had the chance to watch John and Ken work when they built our daughter Alice &amp; her husband Nick's house down the road from our home. When the Struewing brothers built a house, they built the house!  While they used a few subs, they did the bulk of the physical work themselves."
MikeDeWine,1,"He spent most of his life building houses, starting at a very young age by helping his dad, who was a builder. He spent 20 years in California, first working for a landscape architect &amp; then as a carpenter, before returning to Ohio to work with his brother Ken in building homes."
MikeDeWine,1,"Fran remembers one time her dad told John when he was about 12 to tear apart an engine and get it running but to make sure there were no parts left when he was done!  And after John did put it together, there were no parts left, and the engine actually ran!"
MikeDeWine,1,"Like the rest of his family, John was a tireless worker.  He could fix anything -- from a clock to a car to a sweeper."
MikeDeWine,1,"We lost Fran’s brother John this week.  He was 72. When Fran and I were married, I was blessed with five new brothers and sisters.  John was the fourth of Fran’s parents' six children. https://t.co/9cpwpkQDJm"
