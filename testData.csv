BarackObama,0,"From record-breaking job growth to expanding health care coverage, @JoeBiden has spent each and every day working on behalf of the American people. I can‚Äôt say the same about the guy running against him."

POTUS,0,"Today, my Administration is canceling student debt for 277,000 more people ‚Äì bringing the total number of Americans who have been approved for debt relief so far under my Administration to 4.3 million through various actions. I will never stop working to cancel student debt."
POTUS,0,"Today we learned that inflation for companies making things in America was 2.1% over the last year, down 80% from its peak. Profits are also up and higher than before the pandemic. It‚Äôs time big corporations passed those earnings onto consumers in the form of lower prices."
realDonaldTrump,1,"To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th."
realDonaldTrump,1,"The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!"
RealBenCarson,1,"Congratulations to my friend @realdonaldtrump on a dominant Super Tuesday performance! The American people want an America first President back in the White House. Onward to November!"
RealBenCarson,1,"Thanks for having me on @JackPosobiec! We The People can save our republic, check out the interview below."
NikkiHaley,1,"I end my campaign with the same words I began it from the Book of Joshua. I direct them to all Americans, but especially to so many of the women and girls out there who put their faith in our campaign. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid. Do not be discouraged. For God will be with you wherever you go. In this campaign, I have seen our country‚Äôs greatness. From the bottom of my heart ‚Äì thank you America. God bless."
NikkiHaley,1,"Disappointed to see @SpeakerPelosi rip up the speech that mentioned lives we‚Äôve lost and heroes we celebrated at the SOTU. No matter how you feel or what you disagree with, remember others are watching. This was unbecoming of someone at her level in office."
NikkiHaley,1,"Only American citizens should be allowed to vote."
NikkiHaley,1,"No hard-working American without a college degree should have to pay for others' student loans. Period."
NikkiHaley,1,"Trump: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done more in 47 months than you‚Äôve done in 47 years.‚Äù Case closed."
NikkiHaley,1,".@AOC & the Dems who chose to boycott the SOTU. When you represent people, your job is not to just do the things you like. It is to rep ALL people. Listening to the issues by the Pres is your job. Maybe someone else  should step in who is willing to do the job that you aren‚Äôt. üá∫üá∏"
NikkiHaley,1,"Michael is deployed serving our country, something you know nothing about. Someone who continually disrespects the sacrifices of military families has no business being commander in chief."
votetimscott,1,"The U.S. Supreme Court was right to end the illegal and immoral effort by the Biden Administration to transfer student debt to taxpayers. If you take out a loan, you pay it back. Colleges now need to look in the mirror and be held accountable for how expensive college has become. The closest thing to magic in America is a good education and if colleges and universities price themselves out of reach for too many Americans, we won‚Äôt be able to sustain the American Dream. If they don‚Äôt act to lower tuition and improve the quality of their programs, when I‚Äôm president, I will. Additionally, we must strengthen vocational education and apprenticeships. Today, elite universities are not the only path to prosperity. In America, you can go as high as your character, your grit and your talent will take you. That means whether you go to Harvard, Charleston Southern University, or whether you want to be a plumber, welder, or electrician, you too can experience your version of the American Dream. These are the jobs that built America, and these are the jobs liberal elites can't ship to China. College isn't the only path to the American Dream, and it's time for a president who values hard work and the people who do it. Joe Biden won‚Äôt, but I will. #TimOnTwitter"
votetimscott,1,"If you are able-bodied, you work. If you take out a loan, you pay it back. If you commit a violent crime, you go to jail. If you're a man, you should play sports against men. These aren‚Äôt just conservative values, they are American values. As President, I will defend them."
votetimscott,1,"Faith is a cornerstone of American freedom. But under President Biden, our nation is retreating away from patriotism and faith. I will never stop fighting to protect our God-given rights. üßµ #TimOnTwitter"
